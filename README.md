### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file containing detailed information about each sale made by the company. 

### Tools Used
---
- EXCEL- Data cleaning
   - [Download here](https://microsoft.org)
- SQL SERVER - Data Analysis
- POWERBI - Creating Reports

### Data cleaning/ Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we perfomed the following tasks:
1. Data loading & inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves exploring the sales data, to answer key questions such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products sell the most?
- When are sales at peak?
  
### Data Analysis

Include an interesting code worked with:
- Sub Query
- CTE
- Windows function
-  ``` SQL
   SELECT " FROM table1
   WHERE cond = 2i 
   ```

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. The company sales have been increasing steadily over the past year, this has been noticeable during the holiday season.
   
2. Product category A is the best in terms of sales and revenue

3. Customer segments with high lifetime value should be targeted for marketing efforts

### Recommendations
---

Based on the analysis we recommend the following actions:

- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak seasons to maximize revenue

- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.

-Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high LIV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from target and revenue column since they would have affected the accuracy of the conclusion of the analysis. A few outliers still exist but a positive correlation exists between the budget and the revenue.

### References
